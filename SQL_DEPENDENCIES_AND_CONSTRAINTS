These scripts and code snippets are for the management and diagnosis of various SQL and PL/SQL constraints,
dependencies etc, checking tables for references and views based on columns etc.

Not all code and snippets will relate directly to table dependencies and constraints but the code included here
will be for the general area of SQL.
